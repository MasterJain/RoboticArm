# Robotic arm control using Mobile phone 

A Robotic Arm with gripper end effector developed using 3d printed parts (FDM) and arduino  for my undergraduate mini-project requirement.(Mechatronics) 
[Download and Try it out](https://github.com/MasterJain/apex_soundboard/raw/main/apex.apk "Download and Try it out(Android only)")

## Installation 

You can create your own robotic arm by following the steps given below:

-  Download all the STL Files in the app 
    (or alternatively you can download dwg file and convert into STL or use the STEP file whatever works for you üòä)
- Get it 3d printed
- Buy 3 MG996R Servo, 3  SG90 or 3 MG90 Servo (MG90 Recommended), Breadboard, Arduino and HC-05 Bluetooth Module
-  Since MG996R consumes 2A and SG90 or MG90  consumes 0.5A hence a total of 7.5Amps to 8Amps approx
- Buy a 12V 10A SMPS Power Supply and around 8-10Amps step down buck converter to reduce the Amps and Voltage levels
- Open the "Robotic Arm Code.ino" in Arduino IDE or VS Code
- Upload the code to your Arduino Uno or Nano (Arduino Uno Recommended)
- Make connections as per the circuit diagram shown here

- Download the apk file and install
- Turn on the power supply and pair the bluetooth module 
-Connect to bluetooth module via app and voila now you can operate the robotic arm
